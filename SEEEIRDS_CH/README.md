the al3c example uses the "macs.so" file (source code: "macs.so.cpp"), which in turn invokes two binaries which should be kept in this directory:

"macs" (not to be confused with "macs.so"): source code is available from https://github.com/gchen98/macs . 

"allele_spectrum": compile with the "make" command in this directory
